# Vector-Silent-Night
Send Vector into a deep sleep for the night.

Put your required hours for Vector to sleep in the 'Hours_to_sleep = xx'

Vector will go about his normal behaviors until you touch his back sensor, he will then return to his charger, turn off his screen and sleep for the duration entered.

I recommend using crontab to ru the script at the time you require, then all you have to do is touch his back pack before you go to bed.
